Rev. 2

Just rewrote the code. More updates coming in the next few days.

Quite a few people are interesed in this project, but unfortunately the code in the repo was just a dump from my experimental test for an academic project. 

I spend a few days on rewriting it (as a hobby). Let me know if you have any problem with it.


TODOs:

1. Add command line parsing options. ( ...file names are hard-coded now... )
2. Add some comments, clean a little bit more.
